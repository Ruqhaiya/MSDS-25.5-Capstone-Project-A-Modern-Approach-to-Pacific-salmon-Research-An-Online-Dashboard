Angling may still represent a major threat to population sustainability due to incidental mortality (i.e., mortality due to stress or physical damage from hooking or handling) associated with catch and release fishing if angling effort and catchability is high (e.g., Post et al. 2003). Illegal harvest, either intentional or due to misidentification, occurs at an unknown frequency and may also contribute to population declines. Past case studies demonstrate that some Bull Trout populations are capable of recovering relatively quickly (5-10 years) from an over-exploited state under zero harvest regulations\/reduced angler effort or complete angling closures (Johnston et al. 2007; Sullivan 2014).  \r\nIn the absence of information on population parameters, such as catchability and abundance, angling effort (annual rod hours per km) was used as the stressor input value. Angling effort is considered a surrogate for fishing mortality; it is assumed that there is greater mortality at high levels of effort, and lower mortality and low levels of effort.  The approximated relationship between angling effort and system capacity encompasses a linear decline in system capacity with increasing angler effort until an inflection point is reached where additional effort has no further impact on system capacity. The assumption is that there is a proportion of fish in a population that are less vulnerable or invulnerable to anglers, resulting in population resiliency albeit at lower abundance, i.e., fishing mortality alone is not expected to extirpate a population. This may occur because of reduced or variable catchability due to learned hook avoidance, heterogeneity among individual fish, and environmental factors (Askey et al. 2006, Van Poorten \u0026 Post 2011). Additionally, some fish may not be caught because anglers are unable to access all areas of a river system.  These inaccessible areas provide a similar function to marine protected areas by reducing the proportion of the total population available to fishing (Cox and Walters 2002). \r\nThe species-specific shape of the stressor-response curve was based on a series of assumptions. First, we assumed that there was no impact to system capacity at zero angling effort (0 annual rod hours\/km, 100% system capacity). Next, the x-coordinate of the inflection point was set at 18 annual rod hours\/km for Bull Trout, based on Post et al. (2003) that predicted that angling effort above this value would not maintain a viable population of bull trout under catch-and-release regulations. For Westslope Cutthroat Trout this inflection point was set at 50 annual rod hours\/km based on yield-per-recruit modelling that demonstrated a high potential for recruitment overfishing beyond this angling effort under catch-and-release regulations. Parameters used in this modelling exercise included a catchability coefficient of 0.015 (Sinnatamby et al. 2021) and 10% mortality due to both non-compliance and post-release mortality, similar to Post et al. (2003) (Reilly \u0026 Macpherson unpublished data).  The critical angling effort value for Bull Trout is lower than Westslope Cutthroat Trout because Bull Trout exhibit life-history characteristics that make them more vulnerable to overexploitation (e.g., slow-growing, late-maturing, high catchability) (Johnston et al. 2007).  \r\nThe y-coordinate of the inflection point was set as the 95th percentile of system capacity, calculated using all populations experiencing angling effort above the critical value. The 95th percentile was applied because it is expected that the relationship between system capacity and angling effort is better represented by the rate of change near the maximum response rather than the mean response, as system capacity is affected by multiple factors that may vary in their effect. This is similar logic to quantile regression that recognizes numerous unaccounted factors can be driving a response variable (Cade and Noon 2003). This produced inflection point coordinates of 18 annual rod hours\/km and 36% system capacity for Bull Trout (Figure 1) and 50 annual rod hours\/km and 38% system capacity for Westslope Cutthroat Trout. Species-specific fisheries models for Athabasca Rainbow Trout are not currently available.

If successful, Brook Trout may displace or replace, native salmonids (Behnke 1992; Peterson et al. 2004; Fausch 2007; McGrath and Lewis Jr. 2007; Peterson et al. 2008; Earle et al. 2010a, b). \r\nWhile the mechanisms of non-native Rainbow Trout invasiveness have not been fully explored, it is assumed that niche overlap with Athabasca Rainbow Trout results in the replacement, but not displacement of the native trout species. In this theoretical framework, Athabasca rainbow trout are initially lost because of another threat (e.g., overfishing), and the direct stocking or migration of stocked Rainbows results in the replacement of native fish with non-native fish. This assumed no competitive advantage from non-native fish but is simply a factor of few native fish being in the area to allow a natural recovery, in area, versus abundant, locally stocked fish.  This follows the overall theory of competition\/replacement\/exclusion of Volpe et al. (2000). At this time, there is no known system where native fish were abundant yet were replaced by non-native fish.\r\nCompetition only occurs when resources are limited, or the system is near carrying capacity (Dunham et al. 2002). Therefore, researchers should carefully examine available evidence to determine if Brook Trout, non-native Rainbow Trout or Lake Trout are competing with the three native trout species, or if they are taking advantage of resources made available as a result of declining native trout density due to other stressors (e.g., habitat changes, over-exploitation). Relatively high densities of Brook Trout, non-native Rainbow Trout or Lake Trout may indicate that the system is near or at carrying capacity, and therefore, competition may be occurring.  \r\nb.\tHybridization\r\nCurrently there is an ongoing effort to understand the hybridization risk and extent of hybridization of Athabasca Rainbow Trout and non-native Rainbow Trout. Previous genetic sampling and analysis indicate that there are watersheds in the range that have only pure genetics while other watersheds contain a mix of pure and hybridized fish, this information will be refined using current genetic techniques and analysis.\r\nThe stressor-response curve to depict the impacts of competition and hybridization by non-native species on the three native trout species is a simple linear relationship between the ability of a system to hold adult native trout (system capacity) and the capacity used by Brook Trout, non-native Rainbow, Lake Trout, and hybrids (carrying capacity). Native trout system capacity and non-native\/hybridized trout carrying capacity must add to 100% (Figure 1). We have not accounted for the additional adverse effects of hybridization with pure native trout. Rather, this dose-response curve only accounts for competition and replacement related to habitat, so the true negative impacts of these non-native species is likely underestimated.\r\n","function_derivation":"expert opinion","transferability_of_function":"This function was developed and applied to Bull Trout, Athabasca Rainbow Trout, and Westslope Cutthroat Trout in Alberta foothills watersheds. Due to the theoretical nature of the relationship, it could be applied to other species and geographic areas with an acknowledgement of the lack of empirical data on which the function was built. If additional data is available for other systems, those should be incorporated.","source_of_stressor_data1":"Competition by Non-Native Species \r\nCompetition will be considered as occurring in stream reaches (order \u22652) which once held or continue to hold the three native trout species, but now contain predominately Brook Trout or non-native Rainbow Trout at densities that suggest the system is at or near carrying capacity (estimated at approximately 80 Brook Trout or non-native Rainbow Trout \/ 300m, but can be dependent on stream size). Stream electrofishing survey data from FWMIS identified locations with high Brook Trout and non-native Rainbow Trout densities and then expert opinion was used to estimate the stream distance upstream and downstream from this location containing high Brook Trout and non-native Rainbow Trout densities.   \r\nCompetition with Lake Trout was considered as occurring in lakes and reservoirs that once held or continue to hold Bull Trout, but now contain predominately Lake Trout at densities that suggest the system is at or near carrying capacity based on expert opinion. There are relatively few HUC10 watersheds where Lake Trout densities suggest competition may be occurring; these include the Middle Waterton River, Spray River and Abraham Lake watersheds.  \r\nThe input value was the percentage of habitat occupied by Brook Trout, non-native Rainbow Trout and Lake Trout at hypothesized carrying capacity relative to the available native trout habitat within a watershed. \r\n\r\nb.\tHybridization\r\nThe amount of habitat in which non-native rainbow trout are replacing Athabasca Rainbow Trout was compared to historic Athabasca Rainbow Trout habitat in each HUC10 watershed.  Replacement will be considered as occurring in streams and stream reaches (order \u22652) which once held native rainbows, but now contain non-native Rainbow Trout. Using the available genetic data, stream segments identified as near pure (Qi=0.95-0.99) or hybrid (Qi\u003C0.95). Where genetic data was unavailable, these estimates were supplemented with local area knowledge and professional opinion. The input value was the % of stream habitat (kilometers) occupied by non-native rainbow trout relative to the kilometers of available Athabasca Rainbow Trout habitat within a HUC10.\r\n","source_of_stressor_data2":null,"pathways_of_effect":null},"citations":{"citation_text":["Behnke, R.J. 2002.

(2003). Assuming a conditional mortality rate of 20% from natural causes (Post et al. 2003), a Bull Trout population shown to switch from growth overfishing to recruitment overfishing (assumed to occur at \u00bd of maximum system capacity) if the combined conditional rate of mortality from other sources exceeded 8% and extirpation was expected when additional mortality exceeded 12% (Figure 1). Similar to the Angling Effort (incidental angling mortality and illegal harvest) function, there is an assumption that there is a portion of fish in a population that are less vulnerable or invulnerable to direct mortality hence the system capacity does not reach zero. For all three species, the upper limit of direct mortality was not exceeded so the stressor-response curve does not have a flat-tail on the x-axis but this could be seen in the future if the threat of entrainment or research and monitoring increase. \r\n","function_derivation":"Based on data for Bull Trout; Empirical data; Published\/non peer-reviewed; Mechanistic theory","transferability_of_function":"This function was developed and applied to Bull Trout in Alberta foothills watersheds.

","source_of_stressor_data1":"a.\tEntrainment Mortality \r\nFish can become entrained in irrigation canal headworks and killed if not rescued before the canal is dewatered at the end of the irrigation season. Entrainment rates are expected to be variable between canals, however, there have been no recent studies to determine the total number of entrained fish and the overall effect on population sustainability. The primary data source to inform the potential severity of this threat is the Trout Unlimited Canada annual fish rescue program, which includes most but not all canal headworks within the current Bull Trout and Westslope Cutthroat Trout range. Typically, no or small numbers of entrained Bull Trout (\u003C10) and Westslope Cutthroat Trout (\u003C5) are rescued (Lindsey et al. 2015); however, it should be noted that the rescues are not designed to estimate entrainment rates so these numbers should be viewed as minimum values only. In contrast, entrainment at the Belly River canal prior to screening to exclude large fish was estimated at 15 \u2013 20% of annual mortality (Clayton 2001). The majority of canal headworks within Alberta\u0027s eastern slopes do not have fish exclusion devices.\r\nFish can also become entrained in powerhouses for hydroelectric reservoirs where a portion are killed as they pass through the turbines. Various aspects of Bull Trout entrainment in hydroelectric reservoirs have been widely studied in both the U.S. and British Columbia (B.C.) (Martins et al. 2013, Ma et al. 2012, Underwood and Kramer 2007, Salow and Hostettler 2004, and FERC 1995).  Entrainment and mortality rates are highly site-specific, varying with physical factors including reservoir size, dam height, fore bay configuration, depth of intake, turbine type, and operational timing as well as biological factors including fish size, seasonal and diurnal movements and density-dependent influences on fish movement.  While few generalizations can be made, entrainment rates of adult, sub-adult or juvenile Bull Trout can and do impact populations typically as annual losses (i.e., direct morality and permanent loss to downstream reaches) of \u003C5%. For example: 1) Kinbasket Reservoir, B.C., adult Bull Trout - 3.4% loss (Martins et al. 2013); 2) Arrowrock Reservoir, ID, adult Bull Trout - 4% loss, 11% loss when drawn down for maintenance (Salow and Hostettler 2004), and 3) Rimrock Reservoir, WA, sub-adult Bull Trout - 1.4% loss (Underwood and Cramer 2007). Substantially greater mortality rates (9 \u2013 42%, size dependent) are anticipated for the Peace\/Halfway River Bull Trout population during the operation of the Site C Dam in B.C. (Ma et al. 2012). Higher entrainment rates have been recorded at the hydropower operation at the Aberfeldie Dam in British Columbia (Langford 2016). \r\nFor the Joe model, watersheds containing irrigation canal headworks were assigned an entrainment conditional mortality rate of 1% and those containing hydroelectric dams were assigned a rate of 4%, unless other data were available.\r\n\r\nb.\tResearch and Monitoring\r\nStandard scientific methods for monitoring native trout populations typically involve the non-lethal capture, handling, and release of individual fish.  Methods used to capture native trout include electrofishing, angling, trapping, and netting, with backpack and boat electrofishing being the most widely used in Alberta. After capture, fish are held for processing, often anesthetized, and measured. Depending on the project objectives, fish may also be marked (tagged), surgically implanted with telemetry transmitters, and\/or have a small portion of a fin removed for genetic analysis. Lethal sampling of native trout is uncommon but may occur if information that cannot be collected using non-lethal means (e.g., maturity and age data) is required for management and assessment purposes. In these cases, the potential impacts on population sustainability are thoroughly reviewed by the appropriate regulatory agency(s) prior to project approval. \r\nAlberta Fisheries Management has developed a series of standards including the Standard for the Ethical Use of Fish in Alberta (AESRD 2013a), Standard for Sampling Small Streams in Alberta (AESRD 2013b) and Electrofishing Policy Respecting Injuries to Fish (AFMD 2004) to minimize fish injury, stress and mortality during non-lethal collection and handling by research crews. These standards are included as conditions on Research Licences, which are mandatory licences issued to all agencies and organizations conducting fisheries-related work in the province. Research Licences also include a section detailing Best Management Practices relating to the processing of fish in cold and hot weather, proper handling techniques, and the use of anaesthetic. While the application of standards and best management practices does minimize fish injury, stress and mortality, some incidental mortality during fish collection and handling may occur. Incidental mortality is assumed to have negligible to very low population-level effects because the majority of native trout surveys are limited to small representative areas of a watershed and project time periods are typically short (1-5 years). Therefore, mortality due to scientific research and monitoring will not be included in the total annual mortality calculation unless there is evidence of a population-level impact within a particular watershed. Similarly, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service analyzed the effects of scientific research through a biological opinion survey (USFWS 2000) and determined that scientific collection does not jeopardize Bull Trout populations and is therefore not identified as a threat factor in the U.S. Bull Trout recovery plan (USFWS 2015). Nonetheless, this parameter is included in the model and the level of research and monitoring mortality is included in the calculations.\r\nFor the Joe model the conditional rate of mortality due to research and monitoring was set to 0% unless other data were available. Values will be adjusted if new information becomes available suggesting otherwise.\r\n\r\n","source_of_stressor_data2":null,"pathways_of_effect":null},"citations":{"citation_text":["Government of Alberta. 2024.

The shape of the curve and threshold value (5.1 mg\/L) is based on segmented regression of specific growth rate as a function of dissolved oxygen averaged across 30 species. The inference implicit in using growth as the response variable is that threshold effects of low DO on individual growth will be similar to population-level effects. Although the average segmented regression across all species is highly significant and the threshold or 5.1 mg\/L is consistent with previous analyses and regulatory guidelines for water quality, it should be noted that there remains great inter-specific variation around the mean response.  Some species are relatively insensitive to hypoxia, particularly warmwater species, and others (particularly coolwater species and salmonids) showing higher sensitivity (see Fig. 1 below from Rosenfeld and Lee 2022).  \r\n\r\nWe initially assumed that Nooksack dace would be relatively sensitive to low oxygen, as they are a riffle-dwelling species that occupy turbulent and well-oxygenated habitat.  Consequently, our initial inference was to assign then the same sensitivity to reduced oxygen as salmonids, which have a relatively steeper decline in growth with reduced DO than the average for all species (Rosenfeld and Lee 2022, see Fig. 1b below).  However, during sampling for fish in Aug. 2024 we made an observation which suggests that they are not as sensitive as salmonids.  During a fish salvage in Pepin Creek, we placed 2 Nooksack dace in a 4l bucket along with one juvenile coho and 3 juvenile cutthroat trout (young-of-the-year).  It was a warm day, and we inadvertently forgot about the bucket which was placed on the stream bank.  When we checked up on it after an hour, the three yoy trout had asphyxiated, but the coho and the 2 dace were fine, and showed no sign of harm when held in the creek in a flow-through bin before release.  This indicates that Nooksack dace are likely more tolerant of hypoxia than trout, despite being adapted to fast-water habitat, and we therefore used the average growth reduction vs. dissolved oxygen regression in Rosenfeld and Lee (2022; see their Fig. 1a below) as the stressor-response function for dissolved oxygen.\r\n","function_derivation":"Based on data from other species; Empirical data (experimental manipulation); Published","transferability_of_function":"As local adaptations are likely minimal among different Nooksack Dace populations, we would not expect much variation in true tolerance among populations.

Although the average segmented regression across all species is highly significant and the threshold or 5.1 mg\/L is consistent with previous analyses and regulatory guidelines for water quality, there remains great inter-specific variation around the mean response.  Salish sucker is not a cold-water species and therefore, less sensitive to hypoxia compared to salmonids (Rosenfeld et al. 2021; Zinn et al. 2021).  Based on observation and experience, and the assumption that Salish sucker are selected for some degree of hypoxia tolerance because they have evolved in small streams subject to seasonal drying and low flows (and also prefer deep pool or wetland habitat that is subject to intermittent hypoxia), the threshold DO for sublethal effects on Salish sucker has been set at 4 mg\/L (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2019).  We set the x-intercept at 0.5 mg\/L to reflect the higher known tolerance of Salish sucker compared to salmonids (x-intercept \u2248 3 mg\/L) and the average across all species (0.8 mg\/l DO; Rosenfeld et al. 2021, Rosenfeld and Lee 2022).  The habitat suitability index model for Longnose Sucker (Edwards, 1983) generally supports the shape of the function, but has a higher threshold (6 mg\/L) and x-intercept (4.5 mg\/L), reflecting the fact that Longnose sucker (the sister-species to Salish sucker) are a cool-water species.

A similar effect is presumed to occur in other river basins. The data from the Skagit River basin are shown in Figure I.9, along with predicted survivals using an exponential regression relationship. Note that the recurrence interval on the x-axis is based on the Skagit River near Mount Vernon, which is low on the mainstem Skagit.\r\nIn the Chehalis basin, we rescale this relationship to create a multiplier that ranges from 1 at RI = 0 to near zero at RI = 100 (Figure I.10). The equation for the relationship is:\r\n\r\nwhere MultiplierPi is the incubation productivity multiplier and RI is the flood recurrence  interval. In each year of the model run, the multiplier is then calculated using this function, based on the flood recurrence interval for that year. We used peak flow at the USGS gage on  the Chehalis River at Porter as the index flow. Peak flows, probabilities of occurrence, and  recurrence intervals were calculated using the PeakFQ USGS software (https:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/software\/PeakFQ\/).

Plains Sucker can persist in relatively high flow (e.g. Milk River during summer augmentation) and low flow environments (e.g. pools with little to no flow). It is expected that the full stressor-response function for flow will be unimodal in shape, where extremely high flow rates will likely negatively impact Plains Sucker. For example, failure velocity experiments on Plains Sucker showed that fish failed to hold their position at flow rates ranging from 0.08-1.05 m\u2022s-1 (MacLeod 2023); however, Plains Sucker have been found in rivers with mean summer or autumn flow rates that range from 0.3-16.1 m3\u2022s-1. In terms of field data, we have biomass (catch-per-unit-effort; CPUE) data for 6 sites within the Milk River drainage, along with water velocities for the site on sampling day (Teillet et al. 2021). If MAD is calculated using the mean of these values (n=6, MAD=0.14 m\/s) and % system capacity is scaled such that 100% system capacity is the highest biomass estimate from these data, then % system capacity peaks at ~132% MAD. Without more reliable data on biomass or abundance, MAD, the energy expenditure of swimming or maintaining position under various flow conditions, or the full range of stream flow experienced by Plains Sucker we cannot estimate an upper threshold at this time.","function_derivation":"Expert opinion","transferability_of_function":"This stressor-response function is suitable for use on Plains Sucker populations in the Saskatchewan-Nelson and Missouri River drainages in Southern Alberta and Saskatchewan; however, it should be noted that preliminary analyses of experimental data suggest that there may be differences in physiological tolerances to flow between the Milk River populations and other waterbodies because Milk River populations are subject to increased flows annually from April-October and may have adapted accordingly (MacLeod 2023). It may be reasonable to assume the SR function can be applied to Cordilleran Sucker, given the similarity of their physical characteristics (prior to 2023 both species were classified under a single species, Mountain Sucker); however, there is no data to confirm this assumption. It should also be noted that experimental data suggest that Plains Sucker could hold their position at higher flow rates than White Sucker and Longnose Sucker (two other catostomids in the Missouri River drainage; MacLeod 2023); however, only one study was conducted and energetic costs were not considered.

For instance, increased discharge during spring runoff and additional peak flow events throughout the year may result in downstream displacement of emerging fry (Ottaway and Clarke 1981) and have negative effects on spring-spawning species that may be prey for trout (e.g., Seegrist and Gard 1972). Further, Jensen and Johnsen (1999) observed a negative correlation between year-class strength of two fall spawning salmonids and size of peak flood during the spring. There is also evidence that increased frequency of peak flow events can result in short- and long-term changes to river morphology that would impact trout, such as a reduction of habitat complexity and quantity of pool habitat (Lyons and Beschta 1983; Everest et al. 1985; Bonneau and Scarnecchia 1998) and the formation of an \u201coversized\u201d channel.

These thresholds are similar to Equivalent Clear-cut Area hazard categories recommended by Alberta Forestry and Agriculture (Stednick 1996; Guillemette et al. 2005; Mike Wagner pers. comm.).

However, one of the most serious concerns for fish species is the fragmentation of connected riverine habitats, as dams that are not equipped with fish passage facilities can act as complete barriers to upstream and downstream fish movements (Marmulla 2001; GOA 2023, The Alberta Westslope Cutthroat Trout Recovery Team 2013). Many fish populations are likely sustained by metapopulation dynamics, where immigration from source populations ensures the persistence of surrounding subpopulations (Hanski 1998; Dunham and Rieman 1999). As a result, severing lotic connections may limit dispersal, and inhibit the recolonization of small, isolated populations that can be at increased risk of extinction through demographic, environmental and genetic stochasticity (Lande 1998; Morita et al. 2009). While literature has explored fragmentation of sturgeon habitat (Jager et al. 2001), fewer studies have evaluated the effects of dams on stream-dwelling salmonids. Of the available literature, Morita and Yokota (2002) found that extinction risk of White-Spotted Charr (Salvelinus leucomaenis) increased in small and isolated habitat fragments (Morita and Yamamoto 2002; Letcher et al. 2007). For cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii), Harig and Fausch (2002) noted that population success upstream of barriers was strongly linked to available habitat area. Letcher et al. (2007) simulated fragmentation scenarios in a stream-resident Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) metapopulation and found that extinction was likely unless immigration from above barriers was possible or fish exhibited demographic life history changes. \r\n\r\nIn Alberta, it is difficult to quantify the effects of fragmentation due to large dams on the native trout species. The overall population level effect depends on a variety of factors such as patch size, habitat quality, and population size (Morita et al. 2009), as well as life history and behavioural traits (Letcher et al. 2007, Morita et al. 2009) and meta-population dynamics, and in most cases this information is not available for fish populations in the province. It is possible however, to provide a relative, qualitative estimate based on professional opinion considering available datasets. Several hypothetical situations will be described to elucidate this process. In the simplest case, if there are no dams in the system, then there is no effect.  If a dam inhibits movement of migratory Bull Trout into a small portion of the lower watershed they once occasionally frequented (based on telemetry data), a low or very low effect size may be assigned. In contrast, a moderate effect would be assigned if the dam resulted in an isolated, trout population existing in a relatively small habitat patch, with no possible connections to other trout populations. Lastly, the severe decline or functional extirpation of migratory trout downstream of a dam soon after construction may indicate that suitable habitat to support all life history needs is no longer available (high to very high effect size). Until further information is available, the relationship between barrier dam effect size and sustainability of trout populations is assumed to be linear (Figure 1). \r\n\r\n","function_derivation":"Expert Opinion; Based on data from Bull Trout","transferability_of_function":"This function was developed and applied to Bull Trout, Athabasca Rainbow Trout, and Westslope Cutthroat Trout in Alberta foothills watersheds.

Improperly installed road crossings can cause immediate and long-term effects on fish populations by altering habitat characteristics, fragmenting fish habitat and impeding fish movements necessary to complete life history processes (Warren and Pardew 1998; Gunn and Sein 2000; Harper and Quigley 2000; Morita and Yamamoto 2002; Park et al. 2008; Burford et al. 2009; MacPherson et al. 2012).\r\nIn the absence of a provincial road crossing status dataset, the assumption was that relatively high numbers of road crossings indicate a greater risk of habitat fragmentation. Audits of crossing structures in several northwestern Alberta watersheds reported that approximately half of assessed culverts were considered potential barriers to fish passage (Scrimgeour et al. 2003; Johns and Ernst 2007; Park et al. 2008). There is a paucity of studies directly measuring population-level impacts of fragmentation on trout species specifically, although road density has been positively associated with reduced occupancy of the species (Ripley et al. 2005) and is correlated with road crossing densities within watersheds in the Alberta Bull Trout range (R2=0.59, J. Reilly, pers. comm.). The hypothetical relationship between road crossing density and trout system capacity was determined following the risk threshold approach outlined in MacPherson et al. (2012) using the highest estimated road crossing density to indicate the greatest degree of extirpation risk (Figure 1). Although the stressor response curves look very similar for Bull Trout\/Athabasca Rainbow Trout and for Westslope Cutthroat Trout, there are slight differences in the relationship between fragmentation values and system capacity.\r\n","function_derivation":"expert opinion, landscape correlation","transferability_of_function":"This function was developed and applied to Bull Trout and Athabasca Rainbow Trout in Alberta foothills watersheds. Data on Westslope Cutthroat Trout showed a slightly different relationship, so a separate function was used. While fragmentation due to road crossings has been shown to influence many aquatic systems, this function should be applied to other species and systems with caution. ","source_of_stressor_data1":"Number of road and stream intersections per watershed were estimated using the provincial road spatial layer, excluding winter roads and ferry crossings. For Bull Trout, only Strahler order 3-5 streams were considered because bull trout occur infrequently in Order 1 and 2 streams; for Athabasca Rainbow Trout and Westslope Cutthroat Trout and only order 2 and 3 streams were considered because they occur infrequently in Order 1 streams. In Alberta foothills, watercourse crossing datasets have shown that culverts occur infrequently on-stream orders 5 and greater, however, local experts suggested that given smaller stream size and road condition, that culverts could occur on larger stream orders in these watersheds. Therefore, stream orders 2-5 are included in small stream fragmentation calculations.","source_of_stressor_data2":null,"pathways_of_effect":null},"citations":{"citation_text":["Burford, D.D., T.E.
