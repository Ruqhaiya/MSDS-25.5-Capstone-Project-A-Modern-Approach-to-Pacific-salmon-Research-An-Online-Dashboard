The amount of sediment a stream can transport is based on numerous factors including, but not limited to, precipitation, surface water transport, erosion, topography, geology and riparian vegetation (reviewed in Muck 2010). Anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., such as roads, Lachance et al. 2008) can produce substantial inputs of sediments into streams in excess of natural levels. These increased rates of sediment delivery can adversely affect bull trout habitat and have lethal and sub-lethal effects throughout trout life history from egg incubation to adulthood (reviewed in Muck 2010). \r\nPotential impacts caused by excessive suspended sediments are varied, complex and often masked by other concurrent activities (Newcombe 2003), making it difficult to establish the specific effects of sediment impacts on fish (Chapman 1988). The sediment stressor-response curve was developed using sediment estimates obtained from ALCES online based on 2010 footprint and current FSA risk categories for the native trout species (see MacPherson et al. 2019; AEP 2013, 2018, 2019) in the HUC 8 watersheds across Alberta\u2019s East Slopes. FSA risk categories vary from 0 (functionally extirpated) to 5 (very low risk). The dynamic pattern of sediment transport varies from watershed to watershed and aquatic ecosystems have adapted to the natural temporal and spatial pattern of this transport. As such, effects on fish from changes in sediment loading will be relative to natural conditions (Kemp et al. 2011). To capture relative change, sediment in the stressor-response curve was defined as the \u201csediment index\u201d which is measured as potential sediment loading for 2010 (tonnes\/ha\/year) divided by potential sediment loading for 1910 (tonnes\/ha\/year). \r\nThe sediment index (2010 loading\/1910 loading) stressor-response curves were derived by: a) using logistic regression to develop a statistical model relating probability of being within a given FSA category to the log-transformed sediment index; and, b) converting this statistical model into a stressor-response curve relating sediment to the system capacity of the 3 trout species.  Proportional-odds logistic regression was used as the response variable is a multinomial ordered variable (Venables and Ripley 2002).  The proportional-odds assumption of independence among adjacent categories was assessed by comparing similarity of odds ratios among successive categories (Venables and Ripley 2002). \r\nThe stressor-response curve was derived from the proportional-odds logistic-regression models by estimating sediment index levels required for a 90% probability of falling within a given FSA category.  This is similar logic to quantile regression (Cade and Noon 2003) that recognizes numerous unaccounted factors can be driving a response variable.  FSA categories were converted to percent of reference condition using population percentages at transition points between adjacent FSA categories.  \r\nCompared to phosphorus, the data showed a much clearer separation among FSA categories with increasing sediment relative to background 1910 values. An adult FSA category of 4 existed in watersheds when relative sediment increases were negligible. FSA categories of 1 or 0 dominated when sediment increased more than 3-fold over background levels.  Not surprisingly, there was a significant and strong negative sediment effect on association with FSA categories (slope = -2.8, 95% profile confidence interval \u20133.8 to -2.0). The stressor-response curve is shown in Figure 1.\r\nA major issue in assessing the importance of potential stressors in driving a response variable is collinearity amongst different stressors (Zuur et al. 2010).  If different stressors are highly correlated, it is impossible to distinguish relative importance without further experimentation.  There was a high degree of correlation between potential phosphorus loading (tonnes\/ha\/year) and the relative sediment increase across the 73 watersheds (Pearson R = 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.45 \u2013 0.74).  Thus, it was difficult using the available data to separate the importance of phosphorus or sediment independently on system capacity.  Our approach was to create two separate stressor-response curves (i.e., one for potential phosphorus loading independent of the sediment index and vice-versa) and acknowledge that the observed response could be driven by the other stressor.  As the Joe model accumulates cumulative effects multiplicatively (additive on a proportional scale), treating these two curves separately would inappropriately overemphasize the expected response. To overcome this issue, we treated sediment and phosphorus in the Joe model using a limiting factor approach.  Simply, only the strongest, negative response from either the phosphorus or sediment stressor-response curves is used to calculate final system capacity.  Anytime a watershed shows either phosphorus or sediment to be a hypothesized key driver, it must be acknowledged that the other stressor (i.e., sediment or phosphorus, respectively) could be the driver given the collinearity.\r\n","function_derivation":"Empirical data; Correlative model; Landscape correlation; Published\/non peer-reviewed","transferability_of_function":"This function could be applied to any of the three species for which it was developed (Bull Trout, Athabasca Rainbow Trout, and Westslope Cutthroat Trout) within the Alberta range.

The amount of sediment a stream can transport is based on numerous factors including, but not limited to, precipitation, surface water transport, erosion, topography, geology and riparian vegetation (reviewed in Muck 2010). Anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., such as roads, Lachance et al. 2008) can produce substantial inputs of sediments into streams in excess of natural levels. These increased rates of sediment delivery can adversely affect bull trout habitat and have lethal and sub-lethal effects throughout trout life history from egg incubation to adulthood (reviewed in Muck 2010). \r\nPotential impacts caused by excessive suspended sediments are varied, complex and often masked by other concurrent activities (Newcombe 2003), making it difficult to establish the specific effects of sediment impacts on fish (Chapman 1988). The sediment stressor-response curve was developed using sediment estimates obtained from ALCES online based on 2010 footprint and current FSA risk categories for the native trout species (see MacPherson et al. 2019; AEP 2013, 2018, 2019) in the HUC 8 watersheds across Alberta\u2019s East Slopes. FSA risk categories vary from 0 (functionally extirpated) to 5 (very low risk). The dynamic pattern of sediment transport varies from watershed to watershed and aquatic ecosystems have adapted to the natural temporal and spatial pattern of this transport. As such, effects on fish from changes in sediment loading will be relative to natural conditions (Kemp et al. 2011). To capture relative change, sediment in the stressor-response curve was defined as the \u201csediment index\u201d which is measured as potential sediment loading for 2010 (tonnes\/ha\/year) divided by potential sediment loading for 1910 (tonnes\/ha\/year). \r\nThe sediment index (2010 loading\/1910 loading) stressor-response curves were derived by: a) using logistic regression to develop a statistical model relating probability of being within a given FSA category to the log-transformed sediment index; and, b) converting this statistical model into a stressor-response curve relating sediment to the system capacity of the 3 trout species.  Proportional-odds logistic regression was used as the response variable is a multinomial ordered variable (Venables and Ripley 2002).  The proportional-odds assumption of independence among adjacent categories was assessed by comparing similarity of odds ratios among successive categories (Venables and Ripley 2002). \r\nThe stressor-response curve was derived from the proportional-odds logistic-regression models by estimating sediment index levels required for a 90% probability of falling within a given FSA category.  This is similar logic to quantile regression (Cade and Noon 2003) that recognizes numerous unaccounted factors can be driving a response variable.  FSA categories were converted to percent of reference condition using population percentages at transition points between adjacent FSA categories.  \r\nCompared to phosphorus, the data showed a much clearer separation among FSA categories with increasing sediment relative to background 1910 values. An adult FSA category of 4 existed in watersheds when relative sediment increases were negligible. FSA categories of 1 or 0 dominated when sediment increased more than 3-fold over background levels.  Not surprisingly, there was a significant and strong negative sediment effect on association with FSA categories (slope = -2.8, 95% profile confidence interval \u20133.8 to -2.0). The stressor-response curve is shown in Figure 1.\r\nA major issue in assessing the importance of potential stressors in driving a response variable is collinearity amongst different stressors (Zuur et al. 2010).  If different stressors are highly correlated, it is impossible to distinguish relative importance without further experimentation.  There was a high degree of correlation between potential phosphorus loading (tonnes\/ha\/year) and the relative sediment increase across the 73 watersheds (Pearson R = 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.45 \u2013 0.74).  Thus, it was difficult using the available data to separate the importance of phosphorus or sediment independently on system capacity.  Our approach was to create two separate stressor-response curves (i.e., one for potential phosphorus loading independent of the sediment index and vice-versa) and acknowledge that the observed response could be driven by the other stressor.  As the Joe model accumulates cumulative effects multiplicatively (additive on a proportional scale), treating these two curves separately would inappropriately overemphasize the expected response. To overcome this issue, we treated sediment and phosphorus in the Joe model using a limiting factor approach.  Simply, only the strongest, negative response from either the phosphorus or sediment stressor-response curves is used to calculate final system capacity.  Anytime a watershed shows either phosphorus or sediment to be a hypothesized key driver, it must be acknowledged that the other stressor (i.e., sediment or phosphorus, respectively) could be the driver given the collinearity.\r\n\r\n","function_derivation":"Landscape correlation","transferability_of_function":"This function could be applied to any of the three species for which it was developed (Bull Trout, Athabasca Rainbow Trout, and Westslope Cutthroat Trout) within the Alberta range.

A variety of natural and human causes can lead to increases in selenium in fish, including open-pit mining that exposes limestone, increases in sedimentation and run-off, and atmospheric deposition from coal-burning power plants (Barceloux 1999; Lemly 2004). In salmonid fish, observed individual-level effects of selenium toxicity include a decrease in egg incubation time, hatch rate, fry survival, juvenile survival, and juvenile growth (e.g. Hodson et al. 1980, Hamilton et al. 1986, Hamilton et al. 1990). High concentrations of selenium have been detected in east slopes streams in the range of Athabasca Rainbow Trout, apparently caused by open-pit coal mining (Palace et al. 2004). Extensive reviews of selenium in Alberta fishes and waters are found in Fortin (2010) and Pilgrim (2012). \r\n\r\nAt a population level, decreased juvenile survival could result in decreased population size. However, to date most studies have focused on individual-level effects, but results have rarely been extrapolated to the population. The selenium stressor-response curves for Athabasca rainbow trout were derived based on the research of Pilgrim (2012). Units of selenium concentration that best described population-level effects on Rainbow Trout were egg Se (microgram\/gram wet-weight) (Figure 1).\r\n\r\nAlthough the ecotoxicology of elevated selenium levels in warm and cold-water fish has been studied by numerous authors, the effects of selenium contamination remain somewhat controversial (Kennedy et al. 2000, Sappington 2002, Hardy et al. 2010).

Air temperature was used in this analysis because there is currently no province-wide water temperature dataset or model available. Of note, updated spatial stream network (SSN) temperature models are currently in development, but were not yet complete for use in this version of the Joe model. We expect that refinements to the stream temperature model stressor-response curves and watershed input values will occur once these models are complete. In addition, air and water temperatures are typically correlated over time scales \u003E1 week (Mohseni et al. 1998). The minimum and maximum air temperature thresholds (10\u00b0C and 17\u00b0C; Figure 1) were similar to those reported in previous laboratory and field studies investigating the effects of water temperature on Bull Trout growth and survival (Selong et al. 2001) and occupancy (Dunham et al. 2003; Wenger et al. 2011). The findings of this analysis were used to inform the shape of the stressor-response curve below, which characterizes the expected influence of warm temperatures on the system capacity of Bull Trout populations (Figure 1).\r\nThe rapid decline in the number of occurrences of the three trout species on the colder ranges, between 10\u00b0C to 13\u00b0C for Bull Trout, 6\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for Athabasca Rainbow Trout and 8\u00b0C to 13\u00b0C for Westslope Cutthroat Trout is likely due to sampling bias (i.e., there are fewer sampling events in cold, high-elevation areas that are difficult to access). However, in visually inspecting stream temperatures in colonized Jasper National Park streams with excellent Athabasca Rainbow Trout populations they fall within the modelled 5-8\u00b0C temperature range. Therefore, lotic habitats with these colder temperatures were still considered to be excellent Athabasca Rainbow Trout habitat and while cold temperatures undoubtedly can limit Bull Trout and Westslope Cutthroat Trout distributions, for the first iteration of this dose-response curve the results were not extended to the cold side of the curve due to lower confidence in this portion of the analysis.","function_derivation":"Empirical data; Correlative model; Landscape correlation; Published\/peer-reviewed","transferability_of_function":"This function was developed and applied to Bull Trout in Alberta foothills watersheds.

(1983) for Longnose dace temperature suitability, and Pearson (2004) and Gray and Rosenfeld (2024) for Nooksack dace CPUE and yoy growth, respectively. In addition, we considered the expert opinion provided at the workshop conducted in November 2024.  Maximum system capacity was defined by the highest value for both the habitat suitability index, CPUE (fish trap-1), and fish growth, all of which were normalized to a maximum of 1 (or 100%). The overall curve (shape and threshold values) is based on the habitat suitability curve proposed by Edwards (1983) for Longnose Dace. However, the upper threshold and upper and lower y-intercepts (temperatures where system capacity is equal to zero) were modified based on existing Nooksack dace data and expert opinion.  The upper threshold was first set at set at 19\u00b0C based on Edwards (1983) and then shifted to 20\u00b0C based on expert opinion (Mike Pearson, Pers. Comm., 2024) derived during a Nov. 12th 2024 expert elicitation workshop. The lower intercept value of 10\u00b0C was set based on data from Pearson (2004) for the relationship between temperature and CPUE (10\u00b0C was the lowest temperature where fish were caught in traps). The upper intercept was originally set at 23\u00b0C was based on the highest temperature where Nooksack dace were caught in traps and then shifted to 24\u00b0C based on expert opinion (Mike Pearson, Pers. Comm., 2024).   Because larval dace growth experiments reported in Gray and Rosenfeld (2024) indicate higher optimal temperatures than those based on activity (CPUE) of adults, a larval\/yoy dace curve was also generated with a conservatively 2C higher upper bound, assuming that individual growth effects in enclosures will be equivalent to population-level effects.   Note that for general use the adult curves are most appropriate, because they are the more thermally sensitive life stage. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMaximum temperature tolerance \r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that there is anecdotal correlative evidence that Nooksack Dace are potentially more tolerant of higher temperatures (at least for short time periods) than indicated by the upper limit of our SR function.  During the heat dome event of June 25- July 31, 2021, temperatures in Bertrand Creek were significantly higher than the maximum 24C that we identify as zero capacity in the temperature SR function (see flow gauge data screen shot below).  The temperature sensor in the USGS Bertand Creek flow gauge at 0 Avenue on the international border recorded a high of 25.6 C on June 28th, and the accuracy of the temperature sensor is confirmed by a DO\/temperature logger that was placed approximately 50 m upstream on June 30th and recorded approximately the same maximum daily temperature as the sensor at the flow gauge (data from Samantha Ramirez M.Sc. thesis; 23.3 C for USGS gauge, 23.0 C for the DO logger placed ~ 10-20cm below the surface in an unstratified glide habitat). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlthough this data suggests that dace were exposed to temperatures in excess of 24C during this period, it should be noted that this exposure was of comparatively short duration - less than 12 hours on each consecutive day (see horizontal red lines in the figure below).  Although groundwater inputs in lower Bertrand Creek are likely minor, it is also unclwear to what extent dace may have avoided higher temperatures by seeking out deeper water or other refuges. The impact of these thermal exposures on dace are also unclear, in terms of both potential lethal and sublethal effects.  We observed dead juvenile coho and cutthroat trout in Bertrand over this time period, likely as a consequence of low dissolved oxygen and elevated temperatures.  These fish were either floating or visible on the bed of the stream or stream margins.  However, Nooksack dace do not have swim bladders and generally hide in substrate interstices, so that mortalities would have been unlikely to have been noticed.  We did observe some unusual adult dace activity, which included observations of adults swimming during the day (adults are primarily crepuscular or nocturnal), and adult dace swimming in mixed schools of juvenile salmonids, apparently drift feeding or perhaps exploiting higher velocities to maximize oxygen exchange at the gill-water interface. However, this unusual swimming of adults in mixed schools of salmonids, although atypical, has been observed during extreme low-flow conditions when temperatures are warm in years before the Heat Dome event (Jordan Rosenfeld, pers. Obs.), and may also represent a density-dependent switch to drift feeding when benthic abundance becomes depleted.  Larval (young-of-year) Nooksack dace behaviour and habitat use did not appear to be affected by the high temperatures during the heat dome based on behavioural observations and larval dace counts that were taking place during the Heat Dome event.  In terms of potential population level effects, fish abundance estimates from electrofishing in Bertrand Creek riffles in Aug. 2021 (roughly 2 months after the Heat Dome) did not indicate densities of fish that were unexpectedly low, although the absence of 2020 baseline density estimates prevents a precise comparison.  All in all, while the Heat Dome event does suggest some scope for tolerance of temperatures in excess of 24C for durations of up to half a day, the consequences of longer-term exposures (e.g. weeks to months) are unclear. Retaining 24C as the maximum is probably a reasonable conservative option in the short term, but simulations assessing sensitivity of cumulative effects predictions to a higher 25.6 C maximum would be informative.

Stream temperatures are highly variable within and among watersheds and streams, with maximum temperatures ranging from 10.15\u00b0C-39.74\u00b0C in the Milk River drainage (usually in August or September; unpublished data). Lethal maximum temperatures in laboratory experiments can get up to 34\u00b0C [Schultz and Bertrand 2011]) and experimental agitation temperatures ranged from 9.17\u00b0C-31.16\u00b0C, though tolerance was influenced by body size (fish were from the Milk River drainage; unpublished data). Therefore, this SR function was derived using a combination of available field and experimental data. Maximum stream temperature was used for this SR function because we had data on upper thermal limits (agitation temperature) for Plains Sucker; however, it should be noted that this temperature SR function could be adjusted to represent the mean annual stream temperature as the independent variable but the stressor magnitude data must be also reported as mean annual stream temperature.\r\n","function_derivation":"Based on data from Plains Sucker; Landscape correlation; Unpublished; manipulation; Expert opinion","transferability_of_function":"This stressor-response function is suitable for use on Plains Sucker populations in the Saskatchewan-Nelson and Missouri River drainages in Southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. It should be noted that the thermal tolerance literature tends to assume different populations of the same species have similar physiological thresholds to temperature (Hasnain et al. 2010); however, this assumption hasn\u2019t been specifically studied for Plains Sucker. Similarly, it may be reasonable to assume that the SR function can be applied to Cordilleran Sucker, given the similarity of their physical characteristics (prior to 2023 both species were classified under a single species, Mountain Sucker); however, there is no data to confirm this assumption. Further, Plains Sucker from the Black Hills reportedly have an upper thermal tolerance of 32.9\u00b0C-34\u00b0C (Schultz and Bertrand 2011), which is within the range reported for other catostomid species (30.7\u00b0C-37.2\u00b0C, Hasnain et al. 2010). However, given the range of preferred temperatures, caution should be taken when using this function on other catostomids, and it might be more advisable to gauge transferability based on thermal guild (e.g. temperature stressor-response functions for other cool-water species) rather than family.

(2021) and Edwards (1983). In addition, we considered the expert opinion provided at the workshop conducted in November 2024.  Maximum system capacity was defined by standardizing data to the highest value for CPUE (fish trap-1). It should be noted that Salish sucker are thought to be somewhat more warm-adapted than Longnose sucker, which are much more widely distributed and considered to be a cool-water species; temperature data for Salish sucker appears to support this inference, since the temperature curve foe Salish sucker appears right-shifted to higher temperatures relative to Longnose sucker. The final curve was derived by fitting a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to original CPUE data from Rosenfeld et al. (2021). The fitted GAM curve was marginally significant (p\u003C0.1) with wide confidence intervals at the high and low temperature extremes, which is likely due to fewer data points at very low and high temperatures. However, we can be fairly confident that the confidence intervals are in fact likely low at very high and low temperatures, despite the wide intervals implied by the GAM.  This is apparent in the narrower confidence intervals in the CPUE-temperature function fit to temperature classes in Rosenfeld et al. (2021; see Fig. 2 below). The lower and upper x-intercepts in the final function (temperature at which system capacity is 0, i.e., 6oC and 23oC respectively) were determined based on the upper and lower temperatures where fish were caught in traps (see supporting SR function Excel file, cells AK157 and AK 171). The habitat suitability index model for Longnose Sucker (Edwards 1983) provided additional supportive evidence for the shape of the function, as did superimposition of Pearson (2004) data on top of the CPUE-temperature SR function. The function was further modified based on input received at the expert workshop i.e. the response to temperature should be a step faction and therefore, the maximum system capacity (100%) should be a plateau rather than a peak. The temperature range of the plateau was chosen as 14 to 18\u00b0C (Sierra Sullivan and Mike Pearson, Pers. Comm., 2024).

First, it was assumed there was a 1:1 relationship between the minimum available habitat (bottleneck effect) and the three trout species populations system capacity. To measure habitat, an index presented by Hatfield and Paul (2015) was used which: a) sets all flows \u003E20% Mean Annual Discharge (MAD) to a habitat score of 1 (i.e., maximum suitability); b) has a habitat score of 0 at zero flow (i.e., no suitability); and, c) has a habitat score between 0 and 1 for flows between 0 and 20% MAD using a linear relation. This simple rating curve means that a flow of just under 20% MAD will score close to the maximum of 1, whereas a substantially lower flow will score proportionally less. The index was then used to determine the reduction in habitat scores from water withdrawals. Because withdrawals would have the greatest impact on the habitat score during low flows (i.e., \u003C 20% MAD), percent withdrawal was determined for two periods of the year (August and February) and the lowest 10% of flows (i.e., Q90 or 90% exceedance flow) for these months. The approach was then applied to 37 rivers of varying size in Alberta that had year-round natural or naturalized (i.e., corrected for upstream water use) discharge and percent withdrawals ranging from 0\u2013100% were modelled to assess the decrease in the habitat score from natural. \r\nFor February flow, all 37 rivers showed a similar linear response in the habitat score to water withdrawals. This average response was used as the basis for the stressor-response curve (Figure 1A). For August flows, the rivers showed a highly variable response in the habitat score to water withdrawals, ranging from linear (similar to February) to curvilinear with little initial response but increasing as withdrawals increased. The 75th percentile regression using a general additive model (Koenker 2017) was used to capture the curvilinear relationship (Figure 1B). The overall cumulative effects model only includes the season during which water withdrawals have the greatest effect on bull trout as physical habitat is assumed to limit populations by the minimum and not the combined product of February and August habitat.\r\nAs the Joe model accumulates cumulative effects multiplicatively (additive on a proportional scale), treating these two curves separately would inappropriately overemphasize the expected response. To overcome this issue, we treated February and August flow in the Joe model using a limiting factor approach.  Simply, only the strongest, negative response from either the February and August stressor-response curves is used to calculate final system capacity.  Anytime a watershed shows either February or August flow to be a hypothesized key driver, it must be acknowledged that the other stressor could be the driver given the collinearity\r\n","function_derivation":"Theoretical relationships; Landscape correlation","transferability_of_function":"This function was applied to the three species for which it was developed (Bull Trout, Athabasca Rainbow Trout, and Westslope Cutthroat Trout).

Veillard, pers. comm. 22 January 2020). The parasite (Myxobolus cerebralis) can cause high levels of juvenile mortality, and rainbow trout in other jurisdictions have been particularly susceptible (Vincent 1996; Nehring and Walker 1996). No specific studies on the vulnerability of Athabasca Rainbow Trout to whirling disease have been conducted, and it is possible that native stocks of fish are more resistant than hatchery-origin stocks (Baerwald et al. 2011). However, if whirling disease is detected in Athabasca Rainbow Trout streams, it is prudent to manage the effects using information from studies on other strains of Rainbow Trout. \r\nThe stressor-response curve was derived from an Alberta trout age-class cohort model, using variable survival rates on juvenile trout (Sullivan and Spencer 2016).  The population-level effects of whirling disease can be simulated at low, moderate or high levels of risk. This should be qualitatively determined using three factors; the prevalence of whirling disease in the watershed (low, moderate or high), the stream temperature (optimum of 10 0C\u2013 150C mean warmest month = high risk, lower risk at cooler and warmer temperatures), and the gradient of the stream (low risk \u003E4%, moderate risk 2 \u2013 4%, high risk \u003C2% gradient). This follows the Alberta risk assessment concepts for whirling disease (Paul and Reilly 2016). We expect that as Alberta biologists learn more about whirling disease and the key factors that influence its establishment and severity (e.g. Tubifex tubifex density, sediment type, water temperature etc.), and we have the input data to support inclusion within the Joe model, that this stressor-response curve will be refined.","function_derivation":"Expert opinion","transferability_of_function":"This function was developed for and applied to Athabasca Rainbow Trout.

No empirical studies on Athabasca Rainbow Trout and whirling disease are currently available (July 2017).  This is a categorical variable, set to none (0) when whirling disease detection is negative (as distinct to \u201cno testing for whirling disease\u201d). The sensitivity of Athabasca Rainbow Trout to whirling disease is influenced by water temperature and water velocity. If whirling disease is detected in the Athabasca drainage, following Paul and Reilly (2016) the risk of whirling disease should be mapped in GIS along the stream network in the Athabasca drainage. For a given watershed, the whirling disease severity was ranked as the mean associated risk for a stream or river in the watershed. Using the mean (rather than the maximum) gives fisheries managers an estimate of the expected whirling disease risk in the overall watershed but does not account for the possibility of local \u2018hot spots\u2019 based on temperature or velocity. Disease severity can be adjusted according to local knowledge and updated laboratory results.","source_of_stressor_data2":null,"pathways_of_effect":null},"citations":{"citation_text":["Government of Alberta. 2024.
