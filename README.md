# MSDS-25.5

Hello, our team is collaborating with NOAA Fisheries to build an innovative dashboard to replace their current system that’s facing challenges with limited functionality. NOAA plays a crucial role in conserving marine life, and their mission is to ensure the sustainability of Pacific salmon populations.

We'll begin by replicating their existing platform that lets researchers navigate through years of salmon research and helps them understand how environmental factors impact their survival. From there, we’ll elevate its functionality with tools like interactive graphs, cross-research comparisons and automatic summarization of research articles.
 
We also plan to incorporate a life stage dictionary that categorizes these articles to make filtering easier. We’ll introduce a confidence score framework for each paper to quickly assess the reliability of the findings. 

When completed this dashboard will aim to redefine how data supports salmon conservation.
